* Default code-analysis tools settings tend to be overly limiting, force programmer to jump through useless hoops. To fix it:
  * By default disable all checks
  * During code review - note important problems that code-analysis tool could catch, then create/enable corresponding rule
  * This way only useful and important checks will be active
