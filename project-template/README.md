# Simple Java project template 
Contains plugins that are useful in any java project

# Main principles:
* At least two profiles:
    * Run locally - fast, without plugins/tests 
    * Build - slow, with all the plugins and tests. If somebody forgets to build locally before pushing code - build on server will most likely fail, which serves as a reminder.
* Hot-swap (code reloading) should be present
* Should be possible to run specific test in isolation (Ctrl+Shift+F10)
* Endpoint with metrics (e.g. micrometer-actuator)
* Easy way to profile application (while running locally)

# Maven
* To build `mvn clean install`
    * runs all plugins
* To run locally - `mvn spring-boot:run`
    * skips all plugins
#### Plugins: 
* `junit` - runs unit tests
    * to run manually - `mvn surefire:test`
* `fmt-maven` - formats code
    * to run manually - `mvn fmt:format`
* `spotbugs` - spots bugs (better use SonarQube)
    * to run manually - `mvn spotbugs:check`
    * full report - `mvn spotbugs:gui`
    * alternatives:
        * https://pmd.github.io/
        * https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/
* `pitest` - runs mutation tests
    * to run manually - `mvn pitest:mutationCoverage`
    * full report is located in folder `target/pit-reports`
    
# Gradle
* To run - `gradlew bootRun`
* To build - `gradlew clean build`
* To list all possible tasks - `gradlew tasks`
* To generate everything gradle-related, execute `gradle init` 
    (if `pom.xml` is present - generates `build.gradle` based on its content)
#### Plugins: 
* `junit` - runs unit tests
    * to run manually - `gradlew test`
    * full report - `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
* `spotless` - formats code
    * to run manually - `gradlew spotlessApply`
* `spotbugs` - spots bugs (better use SonarQube)
    * to run manually - `gradlew check`
    * full report - `build/reports/spotbugs/main.html`
    * alternatives:
        * https://pmd.github.io/
        * https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/
* `pitest` - runs mutation tests
    * to run manually - `gradlew pitest`
    * full report is located in folder `build/reports/pitest/index.html`
