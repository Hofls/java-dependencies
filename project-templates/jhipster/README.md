# jhipster
* Generates entire project with bunch of dependencies, tests, and great readme!
* Jhipster project used to be here, but it was too hard to search in the repository, so it's gone.

To run locally:
* Install mongodb `choco install mongodb`
* Execute gradle task `bootRun`
* Open http://localhost:8080/
