List of features:
* `auth` - when you need to treat users differently
* `ehcache` - get speed for the price of data getting out of date (when spring cache is not enough)
* `embedded-postgress` - database tests with embedded postgress (when h2db is not enough)
* `graphql` - if rest is not cool enough
* `hibernate` - when working with DB and level of abstraction is too low
* `java-spring` - code examples of java / spring / spring-boot
* `jhipster` - if you dont feel like creating huge project stub manually
* `lombok` - reduces java verbosity (why waste time say lot word when few word do trick)
* `mapstruct` - automate object conversion (e.g. between entities and DTOs) 
* `project-template` - same as JHipster but way smaller
* `rabbit-mq` - allows components of distributed app to communicate with each other
* `redis` - in-memory data store (often used as session cache for disributed systems), simple MQ
* `rest-backend` - API for interaction with backend (+swagger)
* `soap-backend` - interact with backend (oldschool way)
