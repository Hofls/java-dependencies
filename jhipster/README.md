# jhipster
Generates entire project with bunch of dependencies, tests, and great readme!
Jhipster project used to be here, but it made it too hard to search in repository, so it is gone.

To run locally:
* Install mongodb `choco install mongodb`
* Execute gradle task `bootRun`
* Open http://localhost:8080/
